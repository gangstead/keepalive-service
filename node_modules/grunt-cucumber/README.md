# grunt-cucumber-js

> Run all your cucumber features through Grunt.

**Warning:** This task requires a Grunt version of at least `0.4.0`.


## Getting Started
If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to
check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started)
guide, as it explains how to create a
[Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install
and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may
install this plugin with this command:

```shell
$ npm install grunt-cucumber --save-dev
```
Then add this configuration to your project's `Gruntfile.js`.

```js
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-cucumber');
```

## Cucumberjs Task
_Run this task with the `grunt cucumberjs` command._

### Options

#### steps
Type: `String`

Default: `''`

Require files before executing the features. If this option is not
specified, all *.js and *.coffee files that are siblings or below the
features will be loaded automatically. Automatic loading is disabled
when this option is specified, and all loading becomes explicit.

Files under directories named "support" are always loaded first.

#### support
Type: `String`

Default: `''`

Support files let you setup the environment in which steps will be run. If you are using steps option then you have to use support option as well (hooks etc.).


#### tags
Type: `String` or `Array`

Default: `''`

Only execute the features or scenarios with tags
matching TAG_EXPRESSION. Scenarios inherit tags
declared on the Feature level. The simplest
TAG_EXPRESSION is simply a tag. Example:
`tags: '@dev'`

When a tag in a tag expression starts with a ~,
this represents boolean NOT. Example:
`tags: '~@dev'`

 A tag expression can have several tags separated
by a comma, which represents logical OR. Example:
`tags: '@dev,@wip'`

To represent a logical AND, use an array.
This is useful if you want to skip certain features
and run other specific features. Example:
`tags: ['~@wip', '@dev']`

#### format
Type: `String`

Default: `''`

How to format features (default: progress).
Available formats:
* pretty  : prints the feature as is
* progress: prints one character per scenario
* json    : prints the feature as JSON
* summary : prints a summary only, after all scenarios were executed

#### modulePath
Type: `String`

Default: `'cucumber'`

Used to set the path to Cucumber.js's `lib/cucumber.js` 
file if you don't want to load it from the `npm_modules` 
directory using the default `require('cucumber')`. Useful for running
customized versions of Cucumber.js for a specific project. 
It is helpful when you need to modify the Cucumber.js lib
but you can not open source the contributions.

Example: `modulePath: "../../custom_libs/cucumberjs/lib/cucumber.js"`

#### coffee
Type: `Boolean`

Default: `false`

When true, cucumberjs will output code snippets in coffeescript

### Usage Examples


#### Basic Use
```js
// Project configuration.
grunt.initConfig({
  cucumberjs: {
    src: 'path/to/features',
    options: {
      steps: "path/to/step_definitions"
    }
  }
});
```
